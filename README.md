# Notetak

This is a fork of Notetak, it is originially written by Lars Wirzenius:

> Notetak is a small, simple application for taking and managing notes and snippets of text in GNOME. It is inspired by the Notational Velocity application for OS X.
>
> Notetak is written in Python. It requires Python 2.4 (works with 2.7) and the Python bindings for GTK+, GNOME, and Glade libraries (python2.4, python-gnome2, python-gtk2, python-glade2 are the relevant Debian packages).
