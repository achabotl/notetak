# Notetak

This is a fork of Notetak:

> Notetak is a small, simple application for taking and managing notes and snippets of text in GNOME. It is inspired by the Notational Velocity application for OS X.

It is originially written by Lars Wirzenius, (kinda) more details at http://liw.iki.fi/liw/notetak/index.html
